## My process

I started off by organizing the HTML, creating classes to make it easier to style. 
Then I linked my CSS stylesheet to style the color and formatting. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I got to practice centering and building for mobile. The accessibility tests caught that I hadn't used any <h1> tag on the page, which I hadn't known was an accessibility standard. 

### Continued development

I am interested to learn more about accessibility standards, like always having only one <h1> on a site, that I hadn't learned about yet.
